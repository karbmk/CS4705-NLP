  Part 1:

    To run 5 iterations of the EM algorithm for IBM model 1 and calculate the t parameters, run:
      python ibm1.py corpus.en corpus.de
    where corpus.en is the english corpus file and corpus.de is the german corpus file. This takes a few minutes. The output is in the file "t_parameters".

    To print the list of the 10 foreign words with the highest t(f|e) parameter (and the parameter itself) for each English word e in devwords.txt, run:
      python top10.py devwords.txt
