Homework 1: Programming Problems (Q4-6)

*** I'm using my 5 "free" late days on this problem set. ***

This code was written and runs on a computer using python 2.6.6. I've also tested it on the CLIC machines.


REPORT OF RESULTS

Question 4:
Part1: how to run your code step by step

To replace infrequent words (count(x) < 5) in the original training data file (ner_train.dat) with a common symbol _RARE_, run:
python rare.py ner_train.dat

This will produce the file: rare_replaced.dat
which is identical to the training data file ner_train.dat except the _RARE_ keyword replaces words with counts < 5 (and blank lines in the input file are excluded for brevity).


Part2: performance for your algorithm (including precision, recall, and F-score).


Part3: observations and comments about your experimental results. 


Part4: any additional information that is requested in the problem.




Question 5:
Part1: how to run your code step by step (make sure your code can run on CLIC). 
Part2: performance for your algorithm (including precision, recall, and F-score). 
Part3: observations and comments about your experimental results. 
Part4: any additional information that is requested in the problem.
